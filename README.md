# RAY TRACER IN C++

Welcome to the Ray Tracer project! This application is a simple yet powerful demonstration of ray tracing principles, written in modern C++ using the SDL2 library. The project showcases realistic rendering of 3D scenes by simulating light rays, reflections, refractions, and shadows with high accuracy.

## About Ray Tracing
Ray tracing is a rendering technique used to generate images by tracing the path of light rays as they interact with objects in a virtual scene. It accurately models how light behaves in the real world, producing images with lifelike effects such as:

- Soft shadows
- Reflections and refractions
- Depth of field and motion blur (with advanced extensions)

The result is a high-quality image, but with increased computational cost compared to rasterization techniques.
